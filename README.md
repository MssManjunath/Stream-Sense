# StreamSense - Video Event Monitoring System

## Overview
StreamSense is a robust event monitoring system designed to track and analyze user interactions during video streaming sessions. This system captures key events such as play, pause, mute, unmute, seek, and exit, enabling detailed insights into user engagement and behavior. By leveraging a distributed architecture and cloud services, StreamSense ensures scalability and efficiency in handling streaming event data.

## Features
- **Real-time Event Tracking**: Captures user interactions such as play, pause, seek, mute/unmute, and exit.
- **Redis Queue for Asynchronous Processing**: Ensures efficient handling of high-volume event data.
- **MongoDB for Data Storage**: Stores structured event logs for analysis and reporting.
- **MinIO for Object Storage**: Provides scalable storage for large event datasets.
- **GCP Deployment**: Hosted on Google Cloud Platform for high availability and performance.

## Architecture
1. **Client-Side Event Capture**: JavaScript SDK integrated into the streaming service captures user events.
2. **REST API for Event Ingestion**: Events are sent to a backend API that pushes data into a Redis queue.
3. **Redis Queue for Decoupling**: Enhances scalability by decoupling event ingestion from processing.
4. **Worker Nodes for Event Processing**: Consumes events from Redis, processes them, and stores structured data in MongoDB.
5. **MinIO for Large Object Storage**: Stores logs and bulk event data for long-term analysis.
6. **GCP Deployment**: Services are deployed on Kubernetes within GCP for robust scalability and fault tolerance.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI/Flask)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Queue System**: Redis Queue
- **Storage**: MinIO
- **Cloud Deployment**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Kubernetes

## Development & Deployment Steps
1. **Set Up Redis and MongoDB**
   - Deploy Redis for event queueing.
   - Deploy MongoDB for structured event storage.
2. **Develop REST API**
   - Implement API endpoints for event ingestion.
   - Integrate Redis queue for asynchronous processing.
3. **Implement Worker Nodes**
   - Develop background workers to process event data.
   - Store processed data in MongoDB.
4. **Integrate MinIO for Storage**
   - Configure MinIO to store bulk event data.
   - Ensure data retrieval mechanisms are optimized.
5. **Deploy to GCP**
   - Set up Kubernetes cluster.
   - Deploy backend services and workers.
   - Monitor logs and optimize performance.

## Usage
1. **Integrate StreamSense SDK** into a video streaming platform.
2. **Track user interactions** via REST API calls.
3. **Monitor event data** through logs stored in MongoDB.
4. **Analyze insights** using data visualization tools integrated with MongoDB and MinIO.

## Future Enhancements
- **Real-time Analytics Dashboard** for better visualization of streaming insights.
- **Machine Learning-Based Insights** to predict user engagement patterns.
- **Multi-Cloud Support** to enhance scalability across cloud platforms.

## Conclusion
StreamSense provides a scalable and efficient solution for tracking video streaming events, offering deep insights into user engagement. By leveraging modern cloud technologies, Redis-based queuing, and structured event storage, this system enables streaming platforms to enhance their analytics capabilities effectively.
